# IlluminatiBoardGame

## Overview
The IBG project strives to deliver a modern rendition of the classic Illuminati card game from the 80â€™s. This game allows the player to become a member of a mysterious clandestine society where they will engage other organizations in an epic power struggle in attempt to take over the world! (so to speak.) The game is designed to fill the niche for a stimulating multiplayer strategy game. IBG is intended to operate on  Windows or any operating that supports java. IBG was intended to operate on the Windows 10 operating system. It has only been tested on windows 10 thus playing the game using earlier versions of Windows maybe possible but only versions 10 and higher are guaranteed to be compatible.
